   ><h2 id="heading2">Who made Titan Tv man</h2>
    <p id="p2">The Titan TV Man is a Titan created by the TV Men to aid The Alliance in the war against the Skibidi Toilets. The Titan TV Man is around 100-300 feet in height, wears a giant black trench, black jeans with black gloves, it has spikes on its back that can stab Skibidi Toilets or infected Alliance members, and has a purple core. There seems to be black smoke around Titan TV Man when it makes a first appearance and makes a strange sound before starting up its red-light attack. This Titan was presumed to be the strongest out of all, as it is seen in its first appearance in Episode 41 absolutely annihilating a whole division of Skibidi Toilets by using its special hypnotic red light to completely disrupt them and making them flush themselves.</p>
    <h2 id="heading3">Attack</h2>
    <p id="p3">When activated, a red light will shine tremendously while playing the THX sound effect, causing any toilets nearby to "flush" themselves because of the annoying sound.</p>
    <h2 id="heading4">Damage</h2>
    <p id="p4">High (It's red light attack depends on the target, and how many targets there are. It can cause Skibidi Toilets to commit suicide by flushing themselves with it's red light. It can stab the target with it's blades, doing beefy damage or it can kick the target with it's foot, also doing beefy damage.)</p>
    <h2 id="heading5">Durability</h2>
    <p id="p5">Extremely High (This character has demonstrated immense durability in Episode 44, when he is left undamaged after being hit with 2 rockets.)</p>
    <h2 id="heading6">Speed</h2>
    <p id="p6">Average (This character has demonstrated decent speed in Episode 44, where he punched a toilet's glasses off swiftly.)</p>
    <h2 id="heading7">Height</h2>
    <p id="p7">100-300 feet tall</p>
    <h1 id="heading8"> Is Titan Tv man Ok ?</h1>
    <p id="p8">No! In a recent fight with the skibidi toilets.He was doing pretty well against them when suddenly. When he was using it's red-light attack Titan speaker Man climbed up on his body and stabbed on his screen! Which was very bad for him.Since his Armor already destroyed by Saw toilet .With no type of armor left on his body the Skibidi toilet opened fired on him .But luckily he teleported just in time<p>
